The vpp file is to be opened in the Visual Paradigm application. Its basically like an UML of the java classes I have uploaded in the src, not including the test class since that's in the src/test folder. 

Please be sure to have Visual Paradigm installed, then, after downloading the .vpp, open it IN the program. Idk if it will work out of it or how it will look. 

I will maybe add a .txt with some instructions on how to do this practical exercise yourself, but it depends if I get lazy about it or not :)
